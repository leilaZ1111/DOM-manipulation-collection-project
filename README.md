# My Book Collection Exercise

- Type of Challenge: `DOM Manipulation`
- Team challenge: `Solo`
- Deployment strategy: `netlify`

This repository contains a series of exercises destined to practice DOM manipulation using JavaScript. The most interesting among them was the exercise in the folder `3.Collection`, where I created a collection of book cards using JavaScript. The goal was to gather a list of books and create cards for each book with relevant information. The exercise required me to populate the cards using JavaScript without using CSS for styling.

## Challenge Description

The challenge was to create a collection of items based on a chosen topic. I chose "Books" as my topic and proceeded to create a list of 12 Fantasy books. For each book, I gathered relevant information to create cards, including 7 properties per book, such as title, author, year of publication, genre, etc, forming an array of objects. I was then able to create a card for each book using JavaScript and populated the cards with the relevant information.

## Learning Focus: DOM Manipulation

One of the primary objectives of this exercise was to learn and practice DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation using JavaScript. By dynamically generating and updating the HTML content of the page, I gained a better understanding of how to interact with and modify the structure and content of web pages using JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- JavaScript

Please note that the focus of this exercise was on JavaScript functionality, and no external libraries or frameworks were used.
